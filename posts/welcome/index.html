<p>Hi, I am Samh Ghanmi, a Tunisian computer science student interested in Web development
and especially anything and everything related to javascript</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-blog-for-">What is this blog for?</h2>
<p>javascript. Mainly. I would call it Web development but when it comes down to it, it&#39;s basically
all somehow related to javascript in some form or another.</p>
<p>the following are some of the technologies I plan to cover in later posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>javascript; of course, especially the new version ES2015</li>
<li>node.js; this language single-handedly made javascript invade everything : servers, robots,
mobile apps, ...</li>
<li>git &amp; github; these two separate technologies lead version controlling systems</li>
<li>angular2; the next iteration of my favorite MVC (technically, it&#39;s MV*)</li>
</ul>
<p>this is just a broad overview of things i will talk about but it&#39;s in no way exclusive nor complete</p>
<h2 id="how-i-did-it-">How I did it?</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll write a post about it but long story short, it&#39;s a free-hosted website on github
powered by a static site generator. Wait for the post for more details</p>
<h2 id="is-that-it-">Is that it ?</h2>
<p>I know it&#39;s a short post but it&#39;s the first of many so I&#39;ll probably write longer ones in the future.
Stay tuned</p>
